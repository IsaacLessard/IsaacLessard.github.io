#FIARY
## A web app
```
FIARY combines a food diary with a a health tracker. By inputing each meal, its ingredients, and when you get sick, FIARY helps by computing which ingredients you get sick after eating. This helps with finding food allergies, and overall tracking health. Users can discover hidden food allergies or if track if their children have any allergies.

FIARY combines three main functions - the diary, the ability to correlate symptoms with actual ingredients, and the ability to search for recipes.

##About
```
- A website that is a diary for what you eat. Plug in your meals, and also when you feel sick. The app will recommend recipes, tell you your eating history, and will tell you if something you are eating is making you sick, (using a correlation algorithm). 
- This app helps users find food allergies for themselves or their children. It is a website which records everything a user eats alongside when they get sick, and then prints the correlation for the top food items that correlate with being sick. Common practice for general doctors is to tell patients to 'keep a food diary' when they complain about persisting stomach symptoms, and to write down when they get sick. This is burdensome, time consuming, and can be confusing. This app will make this process simple, and help mothers track their children as well.
